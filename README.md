## Section A: Simple Recommendation System using python

We will develop basic recommendation systems using Python and pandas.

In this notebook, we will focus on providing a basic recommendation system by suggesting items that are most similar to a particular item.
We can then use corrwith() method to get correlations between two pandas series. If we sort the dataframe by correlation, we should get the most similar movies.

## Section B: Recommendation System using KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours)

## Section C: Collaborative Filtering Recommendation model

This recommendation is however based on Collaborative filtering which uses easily captured user behaviour data. The rating data is represented using a matrix where users are along the rows and products are along the columns.

* Collaborative Filtering
  * Memory based collaborative filtering
    * User-Item Filtering
    * Item-Item Filtering
  * Model based collaborative filtering
    * Single Value Decomposition(SVD)
    * SVD++
